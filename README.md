# Clone The Repo

Navigate to a folder that you want to put dvwa in and open that folder in a
terminal.

Clone the [repo](https://github.com/digininja/DVWA) or download the zip file of
the code at the
[Github Releases Page](https://github.com/digininja/DVWA/releases)

# Navigate to the right folder

After cloning the repo use the `cd` command to move into the repo you just
cloned with `cd DVWA`. Run `ls` to view the current files in the folder.
